              			Random Forest Regression


1. I created the file in jupyter notebook. And the file name is “random_forest_regression.ipynb” and code
executed under linux system(ubuntu).

2. The library i used
a. numpy,
b. pandas,
c. matplotlib,
d. sklearn

3. I used python3 in jupyter notebook.

4. Running instruction.
a. All the library should be preinstalled which i used.
b. Keep the file “random_forest_regression.ipynb” and “petrol_consumption.csv” at same place.
c. Open jupyter notebook by writing “jupyter notebook” on terminal.
d. It is better to keep both file in home directory.

5. The new file is created after running the code named “petrol_consumption_csv” which keeps
the Average_income of their corresponding columns name “ petrol_consumption”

6. I used scikit learn to train our model “RandomForestRegressor”.
7.Data preprocessing-
 a. To divide the data into attributes and labels

 b. Once the data is divided into attributes and labels, the final preprocessing step in to devide         data into train and test set. Luckily the model_selection library of the scikit-Learn library.contains the train_test_split method that allows us to seamlessly divide data into trainimg ans test sets.


9. Mean Absolute Error,Mean Square Error , Root Means Square Error are the most commonly used metrics for classification tasks. Scikit-Learn’s metrics library contain the classification_report method,which can be readily used to find out the values for these important metrics.
